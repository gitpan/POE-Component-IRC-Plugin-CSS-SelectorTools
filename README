POE-Component-IRC-Plugin-CSS-SelectorTools

This module is a L<POE::Component::IRC> plugin which uses
L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin> for its base. It provides basic CSS selector
making tools. So far there are only two tools, the "link rule maker" and
"multi-selector maker". If you have any suggestions for other tools feel
free to let me know.

It accepts input from public channel events, C</notice> messages as well
as C</msg> (private messages); although that can be configured at will.

The "commands" and their functionality is described under C<triggers>
sub section of CONSTRUCTOR section.
